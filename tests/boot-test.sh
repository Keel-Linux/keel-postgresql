# Boot test of this layer (org-plan section 1), modelled on the one in
# keel-nodebb and keel-mariadb: assemble the published layer chain into an LXC rootfs, boot
# it headless from tests/instance.yaml, wait for the first boot to finish,
# then prove the declarative path end to end. The instance description
# declares secrets.db_password from a file; nothing is configured by hand;
# and the test connects to the database as a client, with that password, to
# say whether it arrived. A listening port would prove nothing here: the
# database listens whatever password it ended up with.
#
# It also checks what the panel offers, because batteries included is a
# property of this distribution: the Webmin module for this database is
# installed and Webmin answers over IPv6 on 12321.
#
# Called by the reusable workflow test-appliance.yml after keel pull and
# keel verify; runnable by hand as root on any host with LXC, see
# tests/README.md. It builds nothing: the layers come from the mirror or
# from a directory bt-layer wrote, so the test needs no fab, deck or
# buildtasks. The logic lives in tests/lib/boot-test-lib.sh and is unit
# tested; this file is the thin main that touches the system.
