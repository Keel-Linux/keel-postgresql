# Line coverage of the shell this layer writes, measured with kcov over the
# bats suite (decision 0004). The measured files are the first boot library
# (lib/postgresql.sh), the first boot hook this layer adds
# (firstboot.d/36pgsqlverify) and the logic of the boot test
# (tests/lib/boot-test-lib.sh) and the build time archive check the recipe
# runs (bin/keel-archive-check); the 95 percent bar of decision 0003 applies
# to all four and all four are at 100. Exits 1 below the threshold, 2 when
# a tool is missing. tests/boot-test.sh is the thin main that runs keel and
# LXC as root and is exercised by the container run in test-appliance.yml,
# not measured here; conf.d/main is a build time script and is exercised by
# the build. firstboot.d/35pgsqlpass is not measured here either: it belongs
# to common, which this layer uses rather than rewrites.
