# keel-postgresql: PostgreSQL, the Webmin module for it, and nothing else.
# Compatible with TurnKey Linux appliances: this is the database half of
# turnkeylinux-apps/postgresql, built as a layer on core so that LAPP and
# any other appliance that needs PostgreSQL is built on it instead of
# installing its own.
#
#     bt-layer postgresql --parent core
#
# What it deliberately leaves out, and why, is in README.rst: Adminer needs
# a web server, and which web server differs by context (lighttpd upstream,
# Apache in LAPP), so it arrives with the web stack, not with the database.

# The project's own packages (inithooks, confconsole, keel) come from the
# build host's APT repository during the build only. The repository is
# copied into the bootstrap and listed as a [trusted=yes] file source,
# because the staging distribution is unsigned; conf.d/main removes both
# from the image and leaves the future apt.keellinux.org entry in place,
# disabled. Same block as keel-nodebb, which is where the pattern is
# maintained.
