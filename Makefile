# keel-postgresql: PostgreSQL, the Webmin module for it, and nothing else.

# turnkeylinux-apps/postgresql, built as a layer on core so that LAPP and
# any other appliance that needs PostgreSQL is built on it instead of
# installing its own.

# What it deliberately leaves out, and why, is in README.rst: Adminer needs
# a web server, and which web server differs by context (lighttpd upstream,
# Apache in LAPP), so it arrives with the web stack, not with the database.

# The project's own packages (inithooks, confconsole, keel) come from the
# build host's APT repository during the build only. The repository is copied
# into the bootstrap and the build verifies it there, the way an appliance
# verifies the release archive (tracker#7): the public half of the staging key
# is installed as a keyring, the source entry names it through signed-by,
# nothing in the tree says trusted=yes, and apt runs with --error-on=any, so a
# signature that cannot be checked fails the build instead of warning about it
# and carrying on. conf.d/main removes the copy of the archive, the source
# entry and the keyring from the image and leaves the future apt.keellinux.org
# entry in place, disabled.
#
# None of the three build time files is for an installed appliance, because
# the staging key signs whatever the build host produced. The removelist at
# common/removelists-final/turnkey takes all three out of the image as well,
# whatever a recipe does. Same block as keel-nodebb, which is where the pattern is maintained.

# and the rebuild installed the packages the archive had held that morning
# without a word. So the tree that is about to be configured is checked on
# every build, whether or not this build made the bootstrap. That check
# verifies the signature with gpgv too, which is what proves this tree at a
