# keel-postgresql: PostgreSQL, the Webmin module for it, and nothing else.
# Compatible with TurnKey Linux appliances: this is the database half of
# turnkeylinux-apps/postgresql, built as a layer on core so that LAPP and
# any other appliance that needs PostgreSQL is built on it instead of
# installing its own.
#
#     git clone --branch v1.0.0 \
#         https://github.com/keel-linux/unit-postgresql.git unit.d/postgresql
#     bt-layer postgresql --parent core
#
# What it deliberately leaves out, and why, is in README.rst: Adminer needs
# a web server, and which web server differs by context (lighttpd upstream,
# Apache in LAPP), so it arrives with the web stack, not with the database.
#
# The server itself is not included from the shared tree any more. It is the
# unit.d/postgresql component (keel-linux/unit-postgresql), which fab resolves
# and applies on its own and bt-layer records in the layer manifest as
# "units postgresql@<version>", so a layer built on this one applies it once
# and a layer built on that one does not apply it again. Decision 0013 is why:
# a database is a component, LAMP and LAPP share apache-php, and a database
# that is a parent layer cannot be shared that way.

# The recipe's own overlay reaches the tree twice, here and again as
# ROOT_OVERLAY after the units, so a file of this overlay still wins over a
# file of the component. No path is in both today, and tests/unit.bats of
# unit-postgresql lists what the component ships.

# Webmin comes from core and answers on 12321; plan/main adds the database
# module for it. Nothing here serves a web page, so 80 and 443 stay shut:
# 5432 is the database, 12321 the panel, 12320 the web shell core carries.

# copied into the bootstrap and listed as a [trusted=yes] file source,
# because the staging distribution is unsigned; conf.d/main removes both
# from the image and leaves the future apt.keellinux.org entry in place,
# disabled. Same block as keel-nodebb, which is where the pattern is
